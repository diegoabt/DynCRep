We present a new generative model for dynamic networks that captures reciprocity while modeling community structure.  
This model aims to generalize to dynamic networks the method [CRep](https://github.com/mcontisc/CRep) presented in [Safdari et al. (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023209), which was of inspiration for the latent variables underlying the generative process. This was also further extended in [JointCrep](https://github.com/mcontisc/JointCRep) presented in [Contisciani et al.(2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10436).
